This is a sample project from a CodeMentor session to query Flickr based off tags and diplay in a TableView.

As text is entered into the searchbar, Flickr is queried and images are displayed in a 90x90 thumbnail via the [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage) Libraray.  Tapping in the row should open a detail view about the image.  (Next Step)
